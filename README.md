# Material Design Lite for Ionic Framework
Bring Material Design to your Ionic based applications. This simple module will update Ionic Frameworks's common components and directives to use [Google's Material Design (Lite)](http://www.getmdl.io/) for the Android platform automatically.

##Why another Material Design library thing?
Material Design Lite reduces a lot of the boilerplate and dependencies on external libraries and frameworks such as Polymer. Other efforts have implemented the Material Design specification badly, built it to be workflow intensive or gets outdated quickly.

This project includes the Google implementation directly allowing for a frictionless implementation and relatively quick upgrade path.

##Override styles for both platforms (iOS/Android)
You can override both iOS and Android platform styles to use Material Design (Lite) by adding a single line of config to your application.

`$mdlConfigProvider.allPlatforms = true`
